ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @cmurga95 (real name is Carlos Murga) <br />
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in data analysis, machine learning and image analysis, particularly bioimages and/or related to sports science. And as far as personal hobbies I love brazilian jiujitsu (currently blue belt), videogames and hiking/backpacking (how original huh) ! <br />
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning machine learning, image analysis and computer vision. Mostly techniques used in image segmentation (for now). <br />
I would like to collaborate in projects that have a positive real impact on people's lives, I like a challenge. <br />
