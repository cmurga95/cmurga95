ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @cmurga95 <br />
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in data analysis, machine learning and image analysis, particularly bioimages and/or related to sports science. And as far as personal hobbies I love brazilian jiujitsu (currently blue belt), videogames and hiking/backpacking! <br />
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m also investing a lot of time in growing my skills in python programming primarily for data analysis, machine learning and statistics. And also my knowledge in both Machine Learning and Statistics. <br />
