👋 Hi, I’m @cmurga95 <br />
👀 I’m interested in data analysis, machine learning and image analysis, particularly bioimages and/or related to sports science. And as far as personal hobbies I love brazilian jiujitsu (currently blue belt), videogames and hiking/backpacking (how original huh) ! <br />
🌱 I’m currently growing my skills in python programming primarily for data analysis, machine learning and statistics. <br />
